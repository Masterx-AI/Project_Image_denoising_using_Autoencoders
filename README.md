# Project_Image_denoising_using_Autoencoders

### Description:
An autoencoder is a special type of neural network that is trained to copy its input to its output. For example, given an image of a handwritten digit, an autoencoder first encodes the image into a lower dimensional latent representation, then decodes the latent representation back to an image. An autoencoder learns to compress the data while minimizing the reconstruction error.

To learn more about autoencoders, please consider reading chapter 14 from Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.
